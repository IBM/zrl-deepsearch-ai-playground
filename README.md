# ML to NLP Workshop

This repository consists of plug and play notebooks -- allowing first exposure to some tasks in machine learning, natural language processing. 

We use pre-trained off-the-shelf models to allow people to interact, enjoy, and play with machine learning. Meanwhile, the tasks expose some well known ML capabilities.

The end goal is to assemble the necessary pieces for explaining the [IBM Deep Search](https://ds4sd.github.io/).

# Tasks

The jupyter notebooks for each tasks is in the `notebooks` directory. 

- [Task 1: Object Detection](https://github.com/IBM/zrl-deepsearch-ai-playground/blob/master/notebooks/task1_object_detection.ipynb)

- [Task 2: Word Embeddings](https://github.com/IBM/zrl-deepsearch-ai-playground/blob/master/notebooks/task2_wordembeddings.ipynb)

- [Task 3: Named Entity Recognition](https://github.com/IBM/zrl-deepsearch-ai-playground/blob/master/notebooks/task3_named_entity_recognition.ipynb)



# Requirements
```
